# Holland Central School District + Erie County BOCES: Student Laptop Policy Reforms

## The Call for Reform
As students of Holland Central School we get many freedoms over our school provided laptops. Freedoms such as but not limited to; the freedom to take it anywhere we want, the freedom to personalize our laptop with stickers, the freedom to use said laptop whenever we want. I feel these freedoms are not adquate for today an I wish to change a few rules to better suit today's modern age.
