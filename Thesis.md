# Holland Central School District + Erie County BOCES: Student Laptop Policy Reforms

## The Call for Reform
As students of Holland Central School we get many freedoms over our school provided laptops. Freedoms such as but not limited to; the freedom to take it anywhere we want, the freedom to personalize our laptop with stickers, the freedom to use said laptop whenever we want. I feel these freedoms are not adquate for today an I wish to change a few rules to better suit today's modern age.

## Current Policy Rules That Could be Reformed
- No apps except school approved apps can be installed on the computer - I believe we can reform this rule by allowing students to download and install any app from the Windows EStore, this fixes the problem with students possibly downloading viruses and it will allow students to download apps without the need for administrative permission. This raises the question, what about students being distracted at school because they are playing something they're not supposed to during school. My answer being; There is a windows setting that restricts access to certain apps or only allows access to certain apps at certain timeframes
- Not every setting can be changed -
